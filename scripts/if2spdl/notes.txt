Notes
-----

Regarding the AVISPA IF report:

- Messages do not seem to contain Varable' as an option, seems to be
  flaw in  the BNF.
- Authenticate has no parameters in it (only constants)
  STSecrecy
  matching_request
 
Regarding translation:
- Read/Send tuples with knowledge updates are horrible.
  Assuming a 1-1 mapping from after knowledge of step n with before
  knowledge of step n+1.
- Public key status in role defs is that of a variable, possible fixes
  by substitutions from the scenario. That is plain ugly: scenario is
  needed to explain meaning of role definition.
