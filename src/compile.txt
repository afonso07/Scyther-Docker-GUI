How to compile Scyther

Requirements expressed as Ubuntu packages where [name][location]

Needed:
	
  [gcc]
  	The C compiler.
  	Note that the current default C compiler on Mac OS X, "clang",
  	will not work. The reason is that Scyther uses nested function
  	definitions, which are not supported by clang.

  [flex]
  [bison]
  	Two tools for the generation of parsers.

  [build-essential]
  	This meta-package includes several development tools used by
  	Scyther.

  [cmake]
	A Makefile generator, available on almost any platform.

  [gcc-multilib]
	Some 64-bit platforms need this to enable 32-bit compilation.


For cross-compilation (Windows):

  [mingw32][universe]
  	GCC variant to compile for windows + w32 binutils.


The best is to simply execute:

  ./build.sh

This should compile everything for your platform and will copy the
binaries into the correct location.
